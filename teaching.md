> I enjoy teaching classes and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students. I 
consider it to be one of the unique privileges of my profession. I think we all have room
for improvement in our lives, and I think teachers and mentors have a unique role
to play in helping someone navigate that journey of improvement.
