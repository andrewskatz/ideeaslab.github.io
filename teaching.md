> I enjoy teaching classes and mentoring students and postdocs, and consider it
to be one of the unique privileges of my profession. My greatest pleasure as a
teacher comes during those moments when students transition from simply
listening and reading the material to actually understanding it, and thereby
advancing to independently solving problems relevant for their future research
career.
