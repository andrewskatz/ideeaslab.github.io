# Summary

> The Improving Decisions in Engineering Education Agents and Systems (IDEEAS) Lab is a research lab run by Dr. Andrew Katz in the Department of Engineering Education at Virginia Tech. We use multi-modal data from inside and outside of the classroom to understand and improve decisions made throughout engineering education systems. Our work is driven by one overarching question: How can we use existing and novel data to support decisions from the individual level up through the organizational level in order to achieve better societal outcomes through engineering education? 

# Selected Projects

## NLP in engineering education teaching and research applications

Motivating Question: How can researchers apply developments from the past decade for understanding student learning, faculty decision-making, and system-wide adaptations over time?
